# Text to Image and Text to Video Generation

## Overview
- A project to generate images and videos from textual descriptions using deep learning models.

## Features
- Generate realistic images from text.
- Generate dynamic videos based on text prompts.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/PyTorch
- OpenCV for video processing
- Pre-trained models (e.g., GPT-3, Stable Diffusion)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Download pre-trained models as per the instructions.

## Usage
- For text to image: `python generate_image.py --text "your description"`.
- For text to video: `python generate_video.py --text "your description"`.
